# hello-world
typical first project
I am a humanoid, age 58. That is a drop of water in the ocean that is the age of the earch. However, 4 generations of dogs would have lived to old-age in my 58 years.  One Galapagos tortise would still be quite young at 58.  I am on the cusp of being a senior.  They sent me an AARP card at 50 and I threw it away. I guess I might consider getting one finally.
